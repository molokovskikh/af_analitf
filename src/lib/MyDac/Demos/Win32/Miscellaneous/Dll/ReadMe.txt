Demonstrates how to work with DLLs in MyDAC-based applications. This demo
project includes two projects:
  1) The My_Dll project represents a dll containing a form that can send SQL queries 
     to the server and display results of these queries.
  2) My_Exe represents a project that uses the My_Dll library to work with MySQL. 

Note, before testing My_Exe, you should build the My_Dll project.
